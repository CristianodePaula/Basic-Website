# Basic website

## 🚀 Starting

Welcome to this project! The goal is to build a simple, beautiful and animated application considering components to be reused in other applications! 

## 🎬 Methods

This project performs a Web Application using the SCC (Simple, Clean, Complete) method, which aims to build a lean, clear and complete code in terms of resources. For this, it will use CSS-in-JSX, through Styled Components and Framer Motion. Through these libraries we reduce the code volume, increase its readability, prevent the existence of css class conflicts, while adding visual resources.
